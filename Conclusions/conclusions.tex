% Despite multiple scope changes throughout the project, the initial requirements ended up being mostly unchanged at the end and resulted in being mostly fulfilled. On the earlier stages of the project, there were plans to extend the requirements to include some physics simulation aspects into the software. Those plans were however abandoned when the team was reduced and the project returned to the original requirements. Most of the requirements of the project are met in full, some of them are only satisfied partially. The appropriate tables include comments explaining how and to what extend those requirements were met.
