High quality virtual reality systems have recently exploded onto the mainstream market for consumers, opening up new means for human-computer interaction. Research into the use of these new devices in commercial and industrial applications has also begun to take up traction. This project aimed to create an architectural visualisation tool for use in with a virtual reality system. Whilst the software created contains a minimal number of tools and utilities, the resulting solution is powerful and allows the user to perform most actions that they would need to do in the process of architecture visualisation and serves as a demonstration of how virtual reality can be used outside of entertainment.
